This project was taught as a Technical Project Workshop for the Association of Computer Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. This project is complete, though small changes may be added in the future. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/UT-ABCS/tech-workshops).  <br />

This workshop will cover the basics of p5.js. The goal of this project is to utilize p5.js to create a bending time slit scan effect from our camera. You can find the slides associated with this workshop at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t0SzjIZWgtaweqK8t00IGsx0xCc3I0N6dpg7MErJRuw/edit?usp=sharing).  <br />
